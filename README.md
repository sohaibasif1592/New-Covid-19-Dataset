# New-Covid-19-Dataset

# Context
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the imminent collapse of healthcare systems following the excessive consumption of financial, hospital, and medicinal resources, the World Health Organization (WHO) changed the alert level on the COVID-19 pandemic from high to very high. Meanwhile, the world began to favor less expensive and more precise COVID-19 detection methods. Machine vision-based COVID-19 detection methods especially Deep learning as a diagnostic technique in the early stages of the disease have found great importance during the pandemic.

# Dataset Description
This is a public COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) chest X-Ray dataset. This data set is collected from the different hospital in pakistan. The labeling of these x-rays was such a tedious and time-consuming process so only 900 x-rays were labeled by experienced radiologists. The aim of this dataset is to encourage the research and development of effective and innovative methods such as deep CNNs which are able to identify if a person is infected by COVID-19 through the analysis of his/her X-rays.
